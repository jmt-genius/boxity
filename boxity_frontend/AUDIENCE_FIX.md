# ✅ Fixed: "Service not found: https://api.boxity.app"

## What Was Wrong:
Auth0 was trying to use an API audience (`https://api.boxity.app`) that doesn't exist in your Auth0 tenant. This is required only if you need to call a backend API.

## What I Fixed:
I made the audience **optional**. Now:
- ✅ If `VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE` is set and valid → uses it
- ✅ If `VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE` is empty/not set → authentication works without it

## Current Status:
Your authentication will now work **without** needing to create an API in Auth0!

## If You Need API Access Later:

If you want to call your backend API (`https://api.boxity.app`) with Auth0 tokens later, you'll need to:

1. **Go to Auth0 Dashboard** → **APIs** → **Create API**
2. **Name**: Boxity API
3. **Identifier**: `https://api.boxity.app` (must match exactly!)
4. **Signing Algorithm**: RS256
5. Click **Create**

Then your existing code will automatically use it.

## For Now:
Just restart your dev server and try logging in again. It should work! 🎉
